🎉 **ELECTRIC GRID PYGAME DEMO - READY TO USE!**

## ✅ Installation Complete

All dependencies are installed and tested. The pygame demo is ready to run!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Guided Demo (Recommended)
```bash
python3 demo_launcher.py
```
- Shows detailed instructions
- Provides verification checklist
- Guided demo experience

### Option 2: Direct Launch
```bash
python3 grid_pygame.py
```
- Launches directly into the simulator
- Good for users familiar with the interface

## 🧪 Verification Complete

✅ **All 3 core tests passed:**
1. Data Structures (Node, Edge, UnionFind)
2. Demo Scenarios (3 predefined test cases)
3. Simulation Logic (cascading failures, connectivity)

## 🎯 Three Demo Scenarios Ready

### 🟢 Demo 1: Stable Grid
- Click "Demo: Stable Grid" → "Simulate Failures"
- **Expected**: Grid remains stable (green)

### 🟡 Demo 2: Overload Test
- Click "Demo: Overload" → "Simulate Failures"  
- **Expected**: Some components turn orange

### 🔴 Demo 3: Cascade Failure
- Click "Demo: Cascade" → "Simulate Failures"
- **Expected**: Multiple failures (red), possible disconnection

## 📁 Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `grid_pygame.py` | Main pygame application |
| `demo_launcher.py` | Guided demo with instructions |
| `verify_demo.py` | Verification script (no GUI) |
| `DEMO_GUIDE.md` | Comprehensive user guide |
| `README_pygame.md` | Technical documentation |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |

## 🎮 Key Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Drag nodes, visual feedback
- **Three Demo Modes**: Stable, Overload, Cascade scenarios
- **Real-time Simulation**: Watch failures propagate
- **Color Coding**: Green=OK, Orange=Overload, Red=Failed
- **Control Panel**: Statistics, buttons, input fields
- **Reset Function**: Restore original state anytime

## 📊 What You'll See

When everything works correctly:
- Pygame window opens (1200x800)
- Grid visualization on the left
- Control panel on the right  
- Three colored demo buttons
- Interactive node dragging
- Real-time statistics
- Color changes during simulation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If issues occur:
1. Check `DEMO_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting
2. Re-run `verify_demo.py` to test components
3. Ensure pygame is working: `python3 -c "import pygame"`

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. **Try all three demos** to understand different failure modes
2. **Experiment** with custom load percentages
3. **Analyze** which components are most critical
4. **Compare** with the original C++ implementation
5. **Extend** the simulation with new features
