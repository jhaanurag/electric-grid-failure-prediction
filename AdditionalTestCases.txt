### Notes
- **Random Variations**: In Test Case 1, the random factor (between 0.5 and 1.5) will affect exact load values, so the output may vary slightly. Check that the logic (e.g., failures when load exceeds capacity) holds.
- **Overload Detection**: The program checks for nodes and edges where load â‰¥ capacity, triggering failures in simulations.
- **Connectivity**: Disconnection is reported when nodes are not linked (e.g., Test Case 5 with no edges).
- **File Output**: The `grid.dot` file will reflect the final state after each simulation or check.
