Chapter 1: Introduction
•	Company profile


•	Overview of training domain
  The training domain involves software development with a focus on data structures and algorithms (DSA) applied to real-world problem-solving, specifically in infrastructure resilience. This project leverages graph-based modeling to simulate electric grid failures, aligning with xAI's mission to provide practical AI-driven solutions.

•	Objective of the project
  The primary goal is to develop a C++ program that models an electric grid as a graph, detects overloads, simulates load increases, and predicts cascading failures. The project aims to enhance grid reliability analysis, provide an interactive user interface, and validate functionality through test cases.

Chapter 2: Training Overview

•	Tools & technologies used
  - Programming Language: C++11 for performance and portability.
  - Development Environment: Standard C++ libraries (e.g., iostream, vector, queue, map, random).
  - Compiler: g++ for compilation.
  - Visualization: Graphviz for rendering DOT files.
  - Operating System: Cross-platform, tested on Linux/Windows.

•	Areas covered during training

  - Week 5: Conducted testing, fixed runtime errors, and documented results.

Chapter 3: Project Details

•	Title of the project
  Electric Grid Failure Prediction

•	Problem definition
  Electric grids are prone to failures due to overloads or load increases, potentially causing blackouts. The challenge is to model the grid, predict failure points, and simulate cascading effects using computational tools, addressing the lack of real-time failure prediction in small-scale grid management.

•	Scope and objectives
  - Model substations and transmission lines as a graph.
  - Detect nodes and edges exceeding capacity.
  - Simulate uniform/random load increases and cascading failures.
  - Provide an interactive interface and file I/O capabilities.
  - Validate with diverse test cases for robustness.

•	System Requirements
  - Hardware: Minimum 2GB RAM, 1GHz CPU.
  - Software: g++ compiler, Graphviz (optional for visualization).
  - Input: User-defined grid data or text files (e.g., grid.txt).

•	Architecture Diagram (if any)

Chapter 4: Implementation
•	Tools used
  - C++11 with standard libraries.
  - g++ compiler for building the executable.
  - Graphviz for visualizing grid state.

•	Methodology
  - Iterative development with unit testing after each module.
  - Top-down design: Graph class as backbone, adding features incrementally.
  - Validation with synthetic test cases to ensure correctness.

•	Modules / Screenshots
  - Graph Class: Manages nodes, edges, and grid operations.
  - Input/Output Layer: Handles user interaction and file I/O.
  - Simulation Engine: Executes load increase and failure propagation.

Chapter 5: Results and Discussion

•	Output / Report
Test Case 1: Moderate load increase (50%) showed no failures with random variations.
Test Case 2: 20% uniform increase triggered edge failures (e.g., A-B, C-D).
Test Case 3: Detected overloaded edge (X-Y) correctly.
Test Case 4: 10% increase with no failures, confirmed connectivity.
Test Case 5: No edges resulted in disconnected grid, as expected. [Detailed outputs match test cases in additionaltestcase.txt.]

•	Challenges faced
Runtime errors due to incomplete lines and undeclared variables.
Balancing random load simulation with deterministic testing.
Ensuring file I/O compatibility across platforms.

•	Learnings
Importance of input validation in preventing crashes.
Efficiency of graph algorithms in real-world applications.
Debugging complex simulations with priority queues.
Chapter 6: Conclusion
•	Summary
The "Electric Grid Failure Prediction" project successfully implements a DSA-based tool to model and analyze electric grid reliability. It effectively detects overloads, simulates cascading failures, and provides an interactive interface, validated by five diverse test cases. While limited by simplified physics and scalability, it serves as a robust educational tool with potential for future enhancements, such as power flow analysis and GUI integration
