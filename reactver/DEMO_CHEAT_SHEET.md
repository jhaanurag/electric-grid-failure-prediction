# üéØ Quick Demo Cheat Sheet

## 30-Second Elevator Pitch
*"This app simulates electric power grids and shows how failures cascade through networks, just like the 2003 Northeast blackout. It uses graph algorithms to find critical infrastructure and includes an interactive DFS visualization that shows exactly how the algorithm works step-by-step."*

## üé™ 6-Minute Live Demo Script

### **Step 1: Show the Problem (30 sec)**
1. Click **"Critical Path (6 nodes)"**
2. Point out red/orange components: *"This grid is already stressed"*
3. Say: *"Let's see what happens when we increase load by just 10%"*

### **Step 2: Interactive Algorithm Demo (1.5 min)**
1. Click **"üîç Show DFS Algorithm"**
2. Explain: *"This shows exactly how Depth-First Search works"*
3. Click **"Step Forward"** a few times: *"Gray=unvisited, orange=in stack, blue=visited, red=current"*
4. Click **"Auto Play"**: *"This is the same algorithm analyzing our grid connectivity!"*
5. Close the visualization

### **Step 3: Demonstrate Cascade (1 min)**
1. Set load increase to **10%**
2. Click **"Simulate Cascading Failures"**
3. Watch the failures cascade
4. Point out: *"Look how one failure leads to another - just like real blackouts!"*

### **Step 4: Show Critical Analysis (1 min)**
1. Click **"Analyze Critical Components"**
2. Explain: *"The DFS algorithm finds single points of failure"*
3. Point to critical components: *"These red items are dangerous - if they fail, the grid splits apart"*

### **Step 5: Compare Resilience (1.5 min)**
1. Click **"Ring Network (5 nodes)"**
2. Try **20% load increase**
3. Show it survives better: *"Redundant connections make it resilient"*
4. Compare: *"Same stress, different topology, different outcome"*

### **Step 6: Real-World Impact (30 sec)**
- *"Power companies use similar analysis to prevent blackouts"*
- *"The 2003 Northeast blackout affected 55 million people - started with one tree"*
- *"This helps identify weak points before they cause problems"*

## üö® Demo Failure Recovery

### **If Something Goes Wrong:**

**App Doesn't Load:**
- Refresh page
- Use backup: "Let me walk you through what this shows..."
- Have screenshots ready

**Demo Runs Too Fast:**
- Slow down: "Let me show that again more slowly"
- Explain each step as you click
- Use the reset button to start over

**Audience Loses Interest:**
- Jump to cascading failure simulation (most visual)
- Ask: "Who's experienced a blackout?" (engage with stories)
- Show real blackout examples on phone/backup slides

---

## üí° Interactive Engagement Ideas

### **Audience Participation:**
- *"What load increase do you think will break this grid?"*
- *"Which component looks most critical to you?"*
- *"Anyone experienced the 2003 blackout? This shows how it spread."*

### **Challenge Questions:**
- *"How would you make this grid more resilient?"*
- *"What's the difference between a tree and a ring topology?"*
- *"Why do some grids fail at 10% increase while others survive 20%?"*

## üì± Backup Materials

### **If Demo Fails - Have Ready:**
- Screenshots of each grid topology
- Example cascade failure sequence
- Video recording of successful demo
- Simple hand-drawn network diagrams

### **Key Statistics to Memorize:**
